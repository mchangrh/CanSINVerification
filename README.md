# Verification and Sources of data

Canada's SIN Number can be verified with the [Luhn Algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

There are references to the geographic location based on prefix of SIN but a citation is difficult to find. [Source 1](http://www.straightlineinternational.com/docs/vaildating_canadian_sin.pdf) 

However, a SIN starting with 9 are issued to temporary workers who are neither Canadian Citizens nor Permenant Residents [Source](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/ei-employers-sin.html)
